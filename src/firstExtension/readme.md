## Taggable Bias Guideline

### Introduction - a Bias Guideline for Data Scientists
In this project, we will present the outcome of the literature review. What are the sources of bias we are mapping to? In each of the data science phases bias can occur for different reasons. An overview of all biases is shown in Figure 3. We find examples and best practices so that we know how to mitigate them. 
The main goal is to give data scientists an overview of the biases that can occur when programming and analyzing data. And how these problems can be solved.
This study is conducted as a master thesis at the RWTH Aachen university.  The task is to find all the biases that occur in each data-science phase and to assign them to the phases. 
The findings in this document are still incomplete at this stage and will be completed in the progress of the master thesis.   

This guideline shall provide an overview in form of a guideline for data scientists to recognize those biases. It provides links to examples and best practice methods.
The data scientist can tag parts of his/her code with bias and mitigation methods and in the end create a summary of keywords towards those tags.
